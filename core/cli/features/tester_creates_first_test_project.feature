Feature: Tester creates first test project
  As a tester
  I want to create a new test project
  So that I can create tests for the system under test

  Scenario: no argument to cli
    When I run the cli without any arguments
    Then the help information should be shown

  Scenario: valid project name
    Given I haven't created a test project
    When I create a test project "test-project"
    Then a new project file with the project name "test-project" is created

  Scenario: invalid project name
    Given I haven't created a test project
    When I create a test project "/"
    Then an error message should be shown, saying "Invalid project name"
